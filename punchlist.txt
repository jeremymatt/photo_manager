Photo Manager Outstanding Tasks
================================

Priority 1: Save with Rotation (Ctrl+Shift+S)
- Resave the current image file with the current rotation applied to the actual pixel data
- Update EXIF orientation tag to "normal" after resaving
- Key binding: Ctrl+Shift+S
- Ref: overview item 8aj

Priority 2: Tag Copy/Paste (Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V)
- Ctrl+C: Copy scene, event, and people tags from current image (NOT other tags/categories)
- Ctrl+V: Paste copied tags to current image (add if not present, don't remove existing)
- CONFLICT: Ctrl+V is currently mapped to APPLY_TAGS_TO_FOLDER
- Need user input on how to resolve the Ctrl+V conflict
- Ref: overview items 8q, 8r

Priority 3: Query/Filter UI
- Add query/filter bar to organizer UI
- Core query engine already exists (query/parser.py, query/engine.py)
- Syntax: tag.person=="Alice" && tag.datetime.year>=2018
- Operators: ||, &&, !=, >, >=, <, <=, ==
- Ref: overview item 6

Priority 4: Export UI
- Export dialog for the organizer
- Core exporter module already exists (export/exporter.py)
- Export to directory structure based on tag categories
- Support copy vs move modes
- Support ">" operator for expanding tag subcategories into directories
- Optional image_metadata.csv export
- Handle multi-tag images (e.g., birthday+vacation -> combined folder)
- Handle missing tags -> "Other" folder
- Ref: overview item 7

Priority 5: Pi Integration (Phase 4)
- systemd service for auto-start slideshow
- system_control.sh script (-on/-off for systemd entries)
- USB storage monitor daemon:
  - Detect USB insertion
  - Check for "photo_manager" directory structure
  - Process add/remove/config updates from USB
  - Sync Pi images back to USB "existing" directory
  - Splash notifications for each operation
- Ref: overview items under "Raspberry Pi additional functionality"

Priority 6: Other Tasks (order TBD)
- "/" key: next image & mark as reviewed (overview 8e)
- Undo queue: Ctrl+Z with configurable queue size (overview 8s, 10a)
- F2 conflict: overview says "recursively remove empty dirs" but currently mapped to Edit Tags (overview 8ab)
- PageUp/Down for dup group nav: plan says PageUp/Down but currently using Alt+Arrow (overview 9b)
- Dup delete refinements: warn if no keeps marked, prompt for tag transfer (overview 9f)
- Alt+T: manually edit tag list of an image (overview 8ai) - may overlap with F2 Edit Tags
- Ctrl+Shift+T: clear an existing tag hotkey (overview 8n second)
- Config completeness: undo queue size, slideshow transition method (overview 10)

Notes on key binding deviations from overview:
- Overview says Shift+Arrow for folder nav; implemented as Alt+Arrow (Shift/Ctrl consumed by Qt)
- Overview says "." for mark delete; implemented as "." (matches)
- Overview says Ctrl+Alt+D for mark-folder-delete; implemented as Ctrl+Alt+D (matches)
